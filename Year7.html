        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
        <p>Editing a photo in Adobe Photoshop can happen in various ways. I prefer to use a method that allows editors to go back to the original at every stage of the editing process.</p>
        <h4>Layering Masks</h4>
        <p>By using layering masks students can select, edit and retouch while keeping the original photo available. This allows students to add the original back in whenever they feel like it.</p>
        <p>Students select parts of their photo by going to Select  Select and Mask. They click on Select Subject and then check the output settings for <em>Layer Mask</em>. With a simple click to OK, their subjects are selected with Photoshop's algorithm.</p>
        <p>This is not always perfect. Students can use a black or white brush in their layering mask to add or subtract from the selection at any time. </p>
        <h4>Harmonisation</h4>
        <p>When you are using different pictures from various sources and you are trying to make it look as one, there can be some issues. You can use to manually go through Photoshop's different adjustment layers. Or you can go up to Filter and choose <em>Neural Filters</em>.</p>
        <p>In this option menu, you can choose <em>Harmonisation</em>. Harmonisation allows you to select a different layer in your project and match the colours and light of your current layer to your selection. Photoshop will use its algorithms to work and provide you with a preview. You can then still do some manual adjustments before approving the output.</p>
        <h4>Exporting</h4>
        <p>When you feel your project is finished, it is time to export. When you export you change your file from a working file to a photo. To do this simply go to File  Export  Export As. For pictures, the most common output is JPG. Set your settings to the maximum quality and press export. </p>

        <p>To practise your Photoshop skills, try to make a collage of multiple pictures from the internet and combine them until it looks like they were always there. You can choose to follow the following steps, or make one of your own.</p>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Find four pictures on free websites like pexels.com or unsplash.com. Download a picture of a:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sky</li>
            <li>Planet</li>
            <li>Classic Building</li>
            <li>Roads</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Open a new document in Adobe Photoshop. The size of your artwork should be 1080x1080 pixels and been set to RGB colour mode. Shown on the right.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Open the file with all your pictures and drag them into your new file, one at the time. This allows each photo to have its own layer and set you up for success when you use the non-destructive editing method mentioned in the <a href="#skills07">Skills</a> section. </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Drag the layers in the order that you want and start editing your photos until you have the composition that you want.</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>When you are happy with your product, export it as a JPG and share it with your friends!</p>
