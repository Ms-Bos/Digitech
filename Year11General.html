            <h3>Data Management</h3>
            <p>Everybody knows the image of that one office worker with piles and piles of paper on their desks. This image is disappearing slowly due to the larger amount of digital files, but that overflowing desk is easily becoming a busy desktop and minutes spend on finding that one document your colleague has asked you for.</p>
            <p>A smart and useful Data Management System will help you with this. It will reduce cluttering of your screen, minimising duplicates and losing your files along the way.</p>
            <p>There are different ways in which you can name your files. The most common one is to name your file after the main content of the document. You can choose to use words or abbreviations. A school project for Digital Technologies about Data Management could be:</p>
            <p>DT.DataManagement.docx</p>
            <p>Having abbreviations for words that are used more often will help you grouping these files together.</p>

        <h4>Planning</h4>
        <p>A project always has several steps that you need to take. To not leave everything to the last minute and miss any requirements, a good process can help you. A good process has the following qualities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phases</li>
            <li>Specific Tasks</li>
            <li>Project Management Tools</li>
            <li>Timeline</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are various tools and skills you can use to keep yourself on track. This include the use of Project Management Software. These often come with project management tools, such as GANTT Charts, Timelines, Mind-mapping tools, and assignment of task when working in a bigger group.</p>
        <h4>Practice</h4>
        <p>Think about all the different steps that you have to take when designing a logo. You should divide your tasks in the following phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>Drafting</li>
            <li>Digitising</li>
            <li>Evaluation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>How long do you think you need for every phase? 1 Day, two weeks or a full month? Ensure that you have a clear start and end date so that you know whether you need to prioritise this project or you can take it a little slower.</p>
