        <h3>Illustrator</h3>
        <p>Illustrator is Adobe's software to create drawings. There is a pencil tool that you can use, but getting nice lines out of it can be a bit of a learning curve. To create, quick, cute logos, there are other tools that you can master quickly to build your logo.</p>
        <h4>Rectangle Tool</h4>
        <p>The Rectangle Tool is one of my most used tools in Illustrator. You can find it in your tool bar on the left or simply press M on your keyboard. By clicking and dragging, you can create rectangles of various shapes and sizes. If you want a perfect rectangle (a.k.a. square), you hold down SHIFT while dragging.</p>
        <h4>Ellipse Tool</h4>
        <p>The Ellipse tool works the same as the rectangle tool that you need to drag and hold to create various ellipses and hold SHIFT for a perfect circle. Sometimes, the Ellipse tool does not show up in your tool bar. This is because it is sometimes hiding behind the rectangle tool. If you right click on your rectangle tool, you will see all the other tools that are hiding behind them. Including the Ellipse tool.</p>
        <h4>Line Tool</h4>
        <p>Another good mate of the Rectangle and Ellipse tool is the line tool. All sitting together in your tool bar, these three tools together can make a lot of different shapes. Important to note is that once you have clicked and dragged your line, it may not show up. This is because the current 'stroke' colour in your properties panel on the right is set to NONE. To change this, click on the outlined colour panel and change it to any colour.</p>
        <p>In the properties panel, you can also change the weight of your stroke and style. The weight you can change by upping the number of pixels (px) and style by clicking on the work STROKE and then changing the caps, corners, and profile. Making these small changes can change the tone of your artwork from very harsh and strict to modern and friendly.</p>
        <h4>Shape Builder Tool</h4>
        <p>Sometimes, you like to use a shape that is not in the shape tools section. That is no problem at all. The Shape Builder tool allows you to build any shape you like. For example, if I want to create the shape of a snowman, I would start by drawing two circles on top of each other. With the two circles selected, I will go to my Shape Builder tool, draw over them and connect them as one shape.</p>
        <p>There are certain shapes that will require you to take away rather than combine two shapes. The Shape Builder tool can do this too. To create a moon, I once again draw two circles. Instead of adding them together, I will hold down ALT (or Option on a Mac) and subtract the circles I do not want. Leaving a crescent shape to be my moon.</p>
       <h4>Curvature Tool</h4>
       <p>The curvature tool looks like a fountain pen with a line in your tool bar and allows you to create curved lines from straight one. This is a particular handy tool if you want to make smileys, waves and other bend lines. Important to understand is that the curvature tool can only work on paths (lines). You start by hovering over the path you want to bend, click to add an anchor point and then drag it until you have the bend you like.</p>
       <p>You can always amend these curves at any point in time.</p> 
       <h4>Selection and Direct Selection</h4>
       <p>In Illustrator, there are two different selection tools. The Selection tool is represented by a black arrow and the direct selection tool by a white one. The selection tool (black) will always select a whole layer, shape or line, whereas the direct selection tool (white) will be able to select parts of layers, shape and lines. This will allow you to round corners of part of your rectangles, or change the curve of one anchor point.</p>
       <p>The white selection tool is great when you want to change part of your art, but if you want to move your artwork as a whole, it is important to use the black selection tool.</p>
