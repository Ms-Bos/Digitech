        <h3>Networks</h3>
        <h4>TCP/IP</h4>
        <p>The internet has several protocols that each computer needs to comply with in order for the computer to communicate via the internet. The main ones are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).</p>
        <p>When your computer wants to communicate with the internet, it will send its request in several data packages. The IP will send these packages through various routers until it is received by its final destination. All these packages can go various routes. The IP ensures that your packages take the route for the quickest and easiest communication.</p>
        <p>As the packages come via different routes, it is important that the receiving computer knows when all the packages are there. This is where TCP comes in. With every data set that is send, a check list is attached. The TCP controls this checklist, questions the sender when not all the packages have arrived and build the data packages in correct order so that the receiving computer can interpret the request.</p>
